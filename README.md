## 📌 About This Repository

This repository contains my HTML & CSS practice projects.

The goal of this repo is to:
- Learn by building
- Experiment with layouts & animations
- Improve responsiveness and UI thinking
- Track my progress publicly

Projects here are iterative and reflect my learning journey.
